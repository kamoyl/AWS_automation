# AWS automation
AWS EC2, S3 and some other (lambda, SNS, CloudWatch, CloudTrail etc) automation scripts (deployment, cleaning, maintenance). the idea is to: run a script and have already fully defined, working environment with all needed services, and appropriately configured policies and secure groups... On the other hands to have a tool, to fully clean AWS AccoundID env.

Because it is a cloud environemnt and some things takes time (deployment of instance, instance being actually up, creating snapshot or image) - all commands are checking if resource is already available.

It works both: in hybrid clouds, and in public one either (I tested it against [CloudGuru sandboxes](https://learn.acloud.guru/cloud-playground/cloud-sandboxes) and it works fine (despite some restriction which is described on CloudGuru site).

Scripts takes care for permissions, relations (to entities) and support error handling; the funniest is that from the scripts and CLI you may collect much more information then AWS console...

Which also means, and it is nice advere effect, that running just info - it collects all information about current env of an AccountAD - with all extra created policies, roles, or other entities, and lots more that that - the most interested it is when run aws_info script against just created CloudGuru sandbox :)

## prerequisites:
- some more-or-less obvious tools: ip, ifconfig, bc, and [grepcidr](http://www.pc-tools.net/unix/grepcidr/)
- already created VPC, IGW and subnet (usually defined by default, tested on newly created free tier account) - there is an assumptions they exist
- created IAM named profile - scripts won't run without providing profile name
- few initial mandatory VARIABLES (they are mostly covered, but they are personal):
  - ```AWS_DEFAULT_NAME``` - for prefixing security groups, policies, roles, instance profiles etc
  - ```AWS_COMMON_NAME``` - for prefixing something "bigger", and for more then one person/instance, like S3 buckets
  - ```AWS_NETWORK_TAG``` - in case there are some TAGs/Names of particular networks (like: private), if empty, then all taken
  - ```AWS_REPO_ADDRESS="https://kamoyl.github.io/AWS_automation/"``` (it is already pointing [here](https://kamoyl.github.io/AWS_automation/), because this repo is cloned on newly created instance and from that repo, and that instance there is a possibility to manage the AWS env also (policy is already properly created)
  - ```SLACK_CHANNEL_AWS```
  - ```SLACK_WEB_HOOK``` (for sending notifications about status of volumes and instances etc)
  - ```SLACK_TOKEN```
- parameters needed:
  - ```DEPLOY_USER``` (-u) - user which have permissions to do what we need to be done on created instance (optional parameter, default: "jenkins")
  - ```AWS_PROFILE``` (-p) - profile with which all commands (AWS CLI) will be run (mandatory parameter)
  - ```AWS_AMI_ID```  (-A) - AMI ID (when there is no local AMI(s)) (optional parameter, by default scripts are trying to figure it out from local AMI(s) which is the newest (created as the latest)
  - ```AWS_INSTANCE_TYPE``` (-I) - optional parameter (default is free tier: "t3.small")
  
## purpose

The main purpose of this repo is to - using only CLI, and as less as possible manual work - create automatically an environemnt for doing some tasks on the fly:
- create tight security group which only ads deployed IP and ssh protocol to access to EC2 instance(s) (only when instance is created)
- create common policy group which adds a group of networks with ssh protocol to access to EC2 instance(s) created by lambda
- create policy
- create role
- attach role to policy
- create an instance profile
- add that role to instance profile
- create an EC2 instance based on an image (own images, but it is very easy to change it to standard one) - choosing the newest one if more
  - each instance when started notifies itself on slack channel
  - each instance when shut down - notifies itself on slack channel (services definitions are in the repo already)
- assign created instance profile to that instance
- assign security policy to the instance 
- create S3 bucket(s) with secure access and encrypted by default
- create a KeyPair - checking if there is already an ssh key of deployer to import it in case
  - use it in case there is something to do remotely
  - remote script functions are prepared to be deployed in background logging output, which is presented with the rest of output
- very simmilar process is done when creating a lambda function which deployes EC2 instance based on delivered image ID (or pick up own newest) and runs appropriate code (of course with different policies, groups etc)
- present details in nice output, with all monthly and annualy costs so far
- CloudTrail (ToDo)
- events (busses, rules etc) - for appropriately deploy and run EC2 with a code, and clean environment afterword
- send appropriate notifications to slack channel - also nicely formatted
  - about costs
  - about own AMIs
  - about working/running instances
  - about volumes
  - S3 buckets (and their features: lifecycle, encryption, secure access etc)
- created instances (doesn't matter if by Lambda or directly) are deployed with 

And also:
- clean the whole environment - if needed:
  - all instance profiles, roles, policies
  - all security groups
  - all instances
  - all volumes
  - all keypairs
  - leaving only own AMIs, and S3 buckets

## parameters:

Each script without any parameter will throw help, but:
### aws_info
  - [-o]  OUTPUT directory - where to store ALL LOGs and TEMP files (default directory is: /${HOME}/var and TMP and LOG are subdirectories to var)
  - [-p]  [mandatory outside AWS env] - PROFILE name stored in ~/.aws/config
  - [-C]  CLEANING (WARNING) - removing all running/stopped instance(s) (terminates them) and all volumes and snapshots
  - [-x]  only works with [-C] - CLEANING (WARNING) - removes: S3 buckets (only empty), Lambda functions, events-busses etc., event rules, Keys etc
  - [-v]  verbose
###aws_deploy
  - those from aws_info except [-C] and [-x]
  - [-E]  deployment of EC2 instance
  - [-L]  deployment of Lambda function with EventBridge schedule
  - [-u]  [optional] - username on remote system which runs commands (if ommited, then "${USER}" is picked up)
  - [-R]  [optional] - run code remotely on just created EC2 instance
  - [-A]  [optional] - AMI_ID         (if ommited, then the newest OWN is picked up)
    - example: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (HVM), SSD Volume Type (ami-032e5b6af8a711f30) - for eu-west-1 AZ
    - example: Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type (ami-0ce1e3f77cd41957e) - for eu-west-1 AZ
    - example: CentOS 7 (x86_64) - with Updates HVM (ami-05a178e6f938f2c39) - for eu-west-1 AZ
    - example of find: "aws --profile saml ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=description,Values=CentOS 7*" | jq '.Images[].Description'"
  - [-I]  [optional] - INSTANCE_TYPE  (if ommited, then "t3.xlarge" is picked up)
